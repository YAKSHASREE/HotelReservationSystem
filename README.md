# HotelReservationSystem

This hotel reservation system has an intercontinental automated system which allows the administration and control of the occupancy of the rooms such as room availability, making a booking, and cancelling the bookings. It also contains the classes representing the concrete hotel room and the respective reservation summarizing that each room to be isolated carries a number, price per day and status as booked or not. Reservations include names as well as details of stay of occupants. The users of the system are able to interact with the system from a command window and view whether rooms are free or taken, book rooms, cancel room bookings and quit the program out. The user interface is designed and implemented in such a way that these chores are able streamlined to address in simple menu options.
